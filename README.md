## Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python**: The core language for data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data cleaning, structuring, and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization libraries used to create plots and graphs that reveal trends and patterns.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: A platform for documenting the data exploration process and organizing analysis workflows.  
- **GitHub**: For version control, collaboration, and code sharing.  

---

## Step-by-Step Code Overview üßë‚Äçüíª

This section covers the key Python skills demonstrated in the project, focusing on data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The full code can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes).

### 1. Data Import and Initial Exploration üì•

The first step was to load the fragrance sales dataset and perform an initial exploration to understand its structure. You can view the full code for this part [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/1_Data_cleaning.html).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('fragrance_sales.csv')

# Display first few rows of the dataset
data.head()
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Using Pandas to load and explore data.  
- **Purpose**: The `.head()` function provides a quick look at the dataset‚Äôs structure, helping to identify key columns and understand the overall data composition.

---

### 2. Data Cleaning: Handling Missing Values and Duplicates üßπ

Next, the dataset was cleaned by removing rows with missing values and eliminating duplicate records to ensure data accuracy. Full code for data cleaning can be accessed [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/1_Data_cleaning.html).

```python
# Remove rows with missing values in key columns
data.dropna(subset=['price', 'brand', 'category'], inplace=True)

# Drop duplicate entries
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Ensure that 'price' is treated as a numeric data type
data['price'] = pd.to_numeric(data['price'], errors='coerce')
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Cleaning data by handling missing values (`dropna()`) and removing duplicates (`drop_duplicates()`).  
- **Purpose**: These operations improve the quality of the data, ensuring that the analysis is reliable and accurate.

---

### 3. Data Transformation: Aggregating Sales Data üìä

After cleaning, the data was grouped by relevant categories to calculate total sales, providing insights into the most profitable product categories. The full code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/2_Data_Analysis.html).

```python
# Group data by category and calculate total sales
total_sales_by_category = data.groupby('category')['sales'].sum()

# Display the results
total_sales_by_category
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Using `groupby()` and `sum()` to aggregate data.  
- **Purpose**: This aggregation helps to summarize sales by category, providing an understanding of which categories perform best.

---

### 4. Price Distribution: Boxplot for Perfume Types üíµ

To visualize price variations across different perfume types, a boxplot was created. This helps compare the price range for types like Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette. Full code for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/2_Data_Analysis.html).

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a boxplot for price distribution by perfume type
sns.boxplot(x='type', y='price', data=data)
plt.title('Price Distribution by Perfume Type')
plt.xlabel('Type')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Creating visualizations using Seaborn‚Äôs boxplot.  
- **Purpose**: This plot provides a visual comparison of price ranges, making it easy to understand the pricing strategies of different perfume types.

---

### 5. Trend Analysis: Perfume Launch Trends Over Time üìà

Next, the dataset was grouped by launch year to analyze trends in perfume launches. A line chart visualizes the number of launches over time, showing market growth. The code for this step can be found [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/3_Sales_Data_cleaning.html).

```python
# Group by launch year to count the number of perfumes launched each year
launch_trend = data.groupby('launch_year')['perfume'].count()

# Plot the trend over time
launch_trend.plot(kind='line', title='Perfume Launch Trends Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Perfumes Launched')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Performing time-series analysis using `groupby()` and line plots.  
- **Purpose**: This analysis highlights the growth of the fragrance market over time, showing an upward trend in new launches.

### 6. Identifying Popular Fragrance Notes üå∏

To identify the most commonly used fragrance notes, the data was analyzed to count the occurrences of each note. This bar chart visualizes the top fragrance notes. Full code for this section is available [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/4_Sales_Data_Analysis.html).

```python
# Count the occurrences of each fragrance note
popular_notes = data['fragrance_notes'].value_counts().head(10)

# Plot the most popular fragrance notes
popular_notes.plot(kind='bar', title='Most Popular Fragrance Notes')
plt.xlabel('Fragrance Notes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Skills**: Using `value_counts()` to rank fragrance notes.  
- **Purpose**: This reveals consumer preferences by identifying the most popular fragrance notes in perfumes.

### 7. Visualizing Top-Selling Men‚Äôs Perfumes üöπ

Lastly, the top 25 men‚Äôs perfumes were visualized in a bar chart, providing insights into the best-performing products in this category. Full code is available [here](https://github.com/andrewhryn/Perfumes/blob/main/4_Sales_Data_Analysis.html).

```python
# Filter the dataset for men's perfumes and find the top 25 by sales
top_men_perfumes = data[data['gender'] == 'Men'].nlargest(25, 'sales')

# Plot the top 25 men's perfumes by sales
top_men_perfumes.plot(kind='bar', x='perfume_name', y='sales', title='Top 25 Men‚Äôs Perfumes by Sales')
plt.xlabel('Perfume Name')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
